	\subsection{Spectral analyses of time series}
	TO DO: vary who I cite here, unify notation across sources\\
	\indent \citet{Sykulski2016} exclusively employs spectral analysis to model the  drifters.  To provide context for the  methods they propose, this section summarize the main concepts of this time series analysis method. More thorough coverage of this material can be found in  \citep{Percival1993}, for example. From a statistical perspective, a time series, $X_{t} = X(t\Delta)$, where $\Delta > 0 $ is the sampling interval and $t = \{1,2,...,n\}$,  can be understood as a realization of a stochastic process over time. Spectral analysis models time series, not in their original time domain, but instead in a frequency domain. This is possible because time series can be represented as infinite sums of exponential functions, known as a spectral representation. Following the presentation of \citet{Percival1993}, the idea of spectral representation can be understood by initially considering the harmonic process,
    	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: harmonic}
		X_{t} = \sum_{l=1}^{L}D_{l} cos(2\pi f_{l}t + \phi_{l}),  t = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2...,
	\end{equation}
where $L$ and  $D_{l}$, and $f_{l}$ are real-valued constants, $\phi_{l}$ are independent Uniform($-\pi, \pi$) random variables, and the frequencies, $0 <f_{l} < 1/2$, are taken to be increasing order. As the number of  sinusoidal functions increases,  more complex behavior can be represented by the sum in Equation ~\ref{eq: harmonic}.  Applying Euler's formula,  Equation \ref{eq: harmonic}, can be written as 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: harmonicSpec}
		X_{t} = \sum_{l = -L}^{L} C_{l}e^{i2\pi f_{l} t}.
	\end{equation}
	
\noindent which as $L \rightarrow \infty$  gives
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: specRep}
		X_{t} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{i2\pi ft}dZ(f),
	\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq: specRep} can be used to define any real or complex-valued discrete parameter stationary process, $X_{t}$, with mean zero. Specifically, there exists a process $\{Z(f)\}$ on $[-1/2, 1/2]$,  where the intervals $dZ(f)$ and $dZ(f')$  are uncorrelated for all $f,f'$, that satisfies Equation \ref{eq: specRep} for all $t$\citep{Percival1993}. This result is known as the spectral representation theorem for discrete parameter stationary processes. An analogous result holds for continuous parameter stationary processes \citep{Percival1993}. 

The relationship between spectral densities and autocovariances also contributes to the utility of analysis in this domain. In particular, the spectral densities of a time series and the autocovariance sequence are the Fourier transform of one another.  In this paper, the focus is on second order stationary processes,  or cases where the autocovariance, $s_{xx}$, is only a function of the distance between the increments,  meaning $c_{xx}(t_{1}, t_{2}) = \mathbb{E}(X_{t1}X_{t2}) = s_{xx}(|t_{1} - t_{2}|)$.  (add derivation here?) In such cases, this relationship is written as 
	\begin{equation}
	S_{xx}(\omega) = \Delta \sum_{\tau = -\infty}^{\infty} s_{xx}(\tau)e^{i\omega \tau \Delta} 
	\end{equation}
and 
	\begin{equation}
		s_{xx}(\tau) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi / \Delta}^{\pi / \Delta}S_{xx}(\omega)e^{i \omega \Delta}d \omega.
	\end{equation}
\noindent where $\omega \in [-\pi/\Delta, \pi/ \Delta]$ is the angular frequency measured in radians \citep{Sykulski2013}
.  In the complex-valued case, $s_{xx}$ and $S_{xx}$ are replaced with $s_{xy}$ and $S_{xy}$ to represent the cross-covariance terms \citep{Sykulski2013}. 

Given an observed time series $X_{t}$, $t = 1,2,..,N$, the common estimator for the spectra is the periodogram, $\hat{S}_{xx}(\omega) = |J_{x}(\omega)|^{2}$ where 
\begin{equation}
J_{x}(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta}{N}} \sum_{t=1}^{N} X_{t}e^{-i \omega t \Delta}. 
\end{equation}
Although simple, this estimator has two known issues: aliasing and leakage.  Aliasing is ... Leakage is... Tapering has been proposed to fix, but has problems.. 


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Model}
\subsubsection{Inertial oscillations}

Inertial oscillations are often modeled with the following set of deterministic differential equations (read and add physics citations)
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u }{\partial t}  + f_{0} \nu &= F - cu \\ \nonumber
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} - f_{0}u &= G - cv
\end{align}
where $u$ and $v$ represent the vertical and horizontal velocity, $f_{0}$ represents the inertial frequency in radians per unit time, and $F$ and $G$ are forces related to the wind. \citet{Sykulski2016} propose instead using a a complex-valued representation of the velocity, $z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)$,  from which we obtain 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dz}{dt} &= \frac{\partial u}{dt} + i\frac{\partial v(t)}{dt}\\
dz &= (F - c u- f_{0}v)dt + (iG - icv + if_{0}u)dt\\
&= fo(-v + iu)dt - c(u + iv)dt + (F + iG)dt\\
&= if_{0}(u + iv) - c(u + iv) + (F + iG)\\
dz(t) &= (if_{0} - c)z dt + (F + iG)dt. 
\end{align*}
We further replace the wind forcing term, $(F + iG)dt$, with complex-valued Brownian increments, which is justified by blah (look up and cite the Mandelrot and Van Ness justification). Thus, we have a stochastic model which retains the desired relationship between the horizontal and vertical velocity components. \citet{Sykulski2016} further let $f_{0}$ be a free parameter, $\omega_{0}$, giving the complex-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic differential equation.
\begin{equation}
dz(t) = (i \omega -c) z(t) dt + A d Q(t), 
\end{equation}
Letting $\omega_{0}$ be estimated by data, rather than fixed at the inertial frequency allows for identification and estimation of the shifts in the angular frequency due to eddies. If the observed angular frequency differs from the inertial frequency, the angular frequency of the eddy can be calculated as $\omega_{eddy} = f_{0} - \omega_{0}$, since $\omega_{0}$ is a sum of the inertial and eddy frequencies.
